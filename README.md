## IPL Runs Inning Per 6 Overs

In this project, I am making a Machine Learning model that can predict the score after every six overs in an inning of match.

### Problem idea:
Given certain input parameters regarding an innings of a T20 cricket match, predict the total runs scored by the batting team at the end of 6 overs.

### Difficulty :
 Medium
 
### Workspace structure:
1. data
   1. all_matches.csv
   1. inputFile.csv
   2. playersList.csv
2. CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
3. CONTRIBUTE.md
4. LICENSE
5. README.md
6. Untitled.ipynb
7. main.py
8. predictor.py
9. requirments.txt

### Data description:
The first row of all_matches CSV file contains the headers for the file, with each subsequent row providing details on a single delivery.
The headers in the file are:

- match_id
- season
- start_date
- venue
- innings
- ball
- batting_team
- bowling_team
- striker
- non_striker
- bowler
- runs_off_bat
- extras
- wides
- noballs
- byes
- legbyes
- penalty
- wicket_type
- player_dismissed
- other_wicket_type
- Other_player_dismissed

Input file is a test set CSV file which have details of 6 overs in 1 inning like: bowlers, batting team.

In players list CSV file conatins all players name in the match.

### Prerequisites: 
* Basic knowledge of cricket(IPL, T-20) 
* Python language skills
* Analytical skills to analyise the data from previous matches and coming up with a code to predict the scores after 6 overs in every innings.

### Requirments:
